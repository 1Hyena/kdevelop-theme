# Custom Color Theme for the KDevelop IDE ########################################

Since the [KDevelop IDE](https://github.com/KDE/kdevelop/) comes with a rather
unpleasant set of color themes, I decided to copy the code highlighting style from
the [Code::Blocks IDE](https://www.codeblocks.org/) and compile a theme file that
could be imported into the KDevelop IDE.


## The Code::Blocks C&C++ Theme ##################################################

This code highlighting theme is compatible with the C and also the C++ programming
language. Below is a screenshot depicting how the theme makes C code appear in the
KDevelop IDE.

The _codeblocks.theme_ file itself is [here](codeblocks.theme).
